Exercise 3: Boot Command

a) Changed the max characters to 20 at readln in bios.S
b) Implemented in assembly the functions strlen and itoa (integer to string) in opt.S
c) Implemented in C the boot command 'strlen' that takes a string and show the actual string that will be read (max 20 characters) and its length

Managing the registers to do what i wanted was pretty challenging, i don't know if the assembly functions are entirely correct, but it's working at least (It Just Works);
The limited memory was a lot of trouble;
Didn't use the utils.c and utils.h files.
